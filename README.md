# Discollection

**UPDATE:** Deleting collections are now implemented natively. Archiving this now.

Your own disposable collection for [Deta Space](https://deta.space/). A developer detonian's cure for an itch.

Discollection's purpose is to become a disposable collection. Since you
still cannot delete collections, this space application is a temporary
solution.

Discollection lets you:

- Privately view it's private key.
- Privately save and delete your generated data keys for backup purposes.
- Download your access keys locally.
